			<!-- Lead Section -->
			<p>At 47, Tamara*—a Black woman from the City of Saint Paul—had hoped for a career in sheet metal work, a field she trained for. But despite her qualifications, she found herself diverted to a role she didn’t initially seek but accepted because it was the first available opportunity.</p>
			<p>“Tile was my last choice, but it’s what was open,” she explained.</p>
			<p>She had seen friends and people of color like herself aspiring to roles in green trades like sheet metal, only to be funneled into jobs that felt like quota fillers, rather than offering true career advancement.</p>
			<p>“I know I might be ‘filling a quota’—I’ve experienced it personally,” she explained.</p>
			<p>While she saw efforts to improve equity in trades, Tamara faced the harsh realities of gender and race-based barriers that remained entrenched in the system, making advancement difficult.</p>
			<p>“It’s difficult to know how positions fill and what role gender plays,” she noted. Lack of transparency in hiring only deepened her frustration.</p>

			<!-- Context + Issue Section -->
			<p>Tamara’s story reflects a national trend. As climate change accelerates, <a href="https://www.plt.org/workingforforests" target="_blank">demand for green jobs</a>—roles in renewable energy, energy efficiency, and green construction—is rapidly growing nationwide, especially in places like Saint Paul, Minnesota. These jobs also present paths for economic growth and wealth-building, particularly in communities facing high environmental risks.</p>
			<div class="flourish-embed" data-src="story/2639945"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script><noscript><img src="https://public.flourish.studio/story/2639945/thumbnail" width="100%" alt="Quality of green jobs visualization" /></noscript></div>

			<p>Minnesota recently reached a record 62,102 clean energy jobs, fueled by federal initiatives like the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). With job growth expected to rise by 6% in 2024, many new roles will address rebuilding critical infrastructure, climate resilience, and environmental justice. Clean energy companies in Minnesota have been adding jobs nearly five times faster than the overall economy..</p>
			<p>Despite demand, the U.S. green workforce remains predominantly white and male: more than 60% of clean energy jobs are held by non-Latin white workers, while Black, Latin, and female workers are underrepresented. This disparity excludes those most impacted by climate change—people from low-income, BIPOC, rural residents, and immigrant backgrounds. Women account for just 30% of the clean energy workforce. Reaching young people is also a problem.</p>
			<p>Many high-quality green jobs offer wages up to 19% above the national mean, yet barriers keep diverse job seekers out, especially women and people of color.</p>

			<p>Zooming into the Minneapolis-Saint Paul region, on average, green jobs pay significantly more than non-green jobs—about $7,369 more annually, with a mean wage of $84,562 per year, or $40.65 per hour—$4.35 more per hour than non-green roles in the region.</p>
			<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/19676115"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script><noscript><img src="https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/19676115/thumbnail" width="100%" alt="Wages in green sectors by sectors for Saint Paul" /></noscript></div>
			
			<p>The City of Saint Paul is investing over $446 million from BIL and IRA funds into climate resilience, green energy, and sustainable manufacturing. Yet, despite this significant investment, access challenges persist.</p>
			<p>To tackle this, Saint Paul and Ramsey County joined TOPCities, a program co-led by the Beeck Center for Social Impact and Innovation and the Centre for Public Impact. During a six-month sprint, TOPCities partnered with Google.org and Goodwill-Easter Seals, a community-based organization, to bridge this access gap and co-design a digital tool connecting job seekers to local green careers. Through human-centered design, they gathered insights from focus groups and interviews with roughly 30 career seekers, predominantly BIPOC, and surveys with local employers to identify key barriers and co-design opportunity areas that meet community and employer needs.</p>
			
			<!-- Missing Faces in Green Jobs Section -->
			<h2>Missing faces in green jobs</h2>

			<h4>By gender</h4>
			<p>Women face additional barriers. Though they make up over half of Saint Paul’s population, they remain underrepresented in mid- and high-quality green jobs. Men dominate fields like construction and renewable energy, where roles tend to be higher paying and offer more stability and advancement opportunities.</p>
			<p>Instead, many women find themselves in low-quality roles, if they manage to enter the green sector at all.</p>
			<p>As one focus group participant explained, “They test employees in the construction culture. My dad told me how they do it. I noticed that out of seven women hired, most did not pass the physical test. It is very hard.” Other women noted ongoing pay inequities and limited advancement opportunities in these fields.</p>
			<p>“Gender plays a role, as women are paid less,” noted one participant. Another observed, “Women in construction are still rare—seeing more, but only a handful. There are barriers and gender expectations, especially for someone of color.”</p>

			<h4>By race</h4>
			<p>In a city where over 41% of residents are people of color, BIPOC communities are notably underrepresented in high-quality green jobs. Black or African American individuals, who make up nearly 16% of the population, are more often in low-quality, lower-paying roles. White workers, meanwhile, dominate mid- and high-quality positions.</p>
			<p>A focus group participant highlighted these systemic issues, saying, “People don’t get hired because of race. This is America.”</p>
			<p>Concerns over race shape broader career decisions, and for those with intersecting identities, barriers deepen, especially when discrimination compounds with other challenges like criminal records. “In my past, I used to worry about criminal history and getting hired—certain crimes, race too,” shared another participant.</p>
			<p>One participant shared, “My experience as a woman in construction was different from a peer’s experience as a woman of color in the same field.”</p>

						<p>High-quality green jobs in Saint Paul often require <a href="#story/2682595/slide-3">advanced degrees</a>, but educational disparities limit access for many without formal qualifications..</p>
			
						<!-- End of Scrollytelling section -->

			<h4>By education</h4>
			<p>In Saint Paul, while 43% of residents over 25 have a bachelor’s degree—above the national average—this level of education is unevenly distributed. Many green jobs demand advanced degrees or certifications. For those with only a high school diploma or vocational training, access to higher-quality roles remains out of reach.</p>
			<p>For many, transitioning into these roles requires more than just obtaining a certificate—it involves navigating a system that often prioritizes formal education. In a Beeck analysis, a bachelor’s degree is often seen as a prerequisite for high-quality roles, particularly in sectors like energy efficiency. Those with less formal education, such as GEDs or some college experience, skew towards low-quality jobs across all sectors.</p>
			<p>TOPCities’ focus groups highlighted that barriers tied to education and age affect green career entry. “Not everybody will have the education to be ready. We will need to start at the base level for some people,” one participant said, stressing the need for alternative pathways. Marcus, a 51-year-old with construction training, recounted applying for jobs but rarely hearing back: “I graduated from construction training, and I’ve been applying for jobs. I get emails from companies, but nothing yet.” Similarly, Diego, an AmeriCorps graduate, felt discouraged by a lack of responses, “I graduated from construction, and they are not hiring.” Even with relevant training, many job seekers struggle to break into green sectors, even when they have relevant training.</p>
			<p>Age also plays a role, as one participant observed, “Being too young to take training can be a barrier, as they ask you when you ask about the training they offer.”</p>
			<p>Employers, too, recognize this gap. While some welcomed candidates without degrees, they noted a need for hands-on experience and problem-solving skills—qualities hard to showcase without prior industry exposure. “We look for people with problem-solving skills and a team mentality when hiring. A degree can be useful, but it is not necessary to get hired or promoted within our field,” shared one employer. Many employers also prioritize technical roles requiring certifications or specialized training, which limits access for those with only general skills.</p>
			<p>According to Ramsey County’s employer survey in TOPCities, hiring practices show a trend toward skilled roles like machine operators, technicians, and licensed trades, often favoring vocational qualifications and certifications. Many companies invest in retention through upskilling programs, mentorships, and tuition reimbursement, yet entry barriers remain high for those without formal credentials or experience.</p>

			<!-- Barriers to Entry Section -->
			<h2>Barriers to entry</h2>
			<p>Access to green jobs in Saint Paul is limited by a complex web of systemic, educational, and economic factors. Even though opportunities are expanding, historical legacies, entrenched inequities, and recruitment practices keep many qualified candidates out of high-quality green roles.</p>
			
			<p>Limited access to green jobs in Saint Paul is shaped by a complex web of historical inequities, systemic barriers, and current-day recruitment challenges. These obstacles keep many qualified candidates out of the growing green economy.</p>
			
			<h4>Redlining’s legacy</h4>
			<p>The lasting effects of redlining, which historically restricted housing and services based on race, continue to affect job access, housing stability, and economic opportunity. In central neighborhoods, past disinvestment and projects like the destruction of Rondo, a historic Black neighborhood, for the construction of Interstate 94, have created entrenched economic disparities that limit pathways to homeownership and stable employment.</p>
			
			<p>This wealth gap between white and non-white residents restricts access to higher-paying jobs that require educational investment and skill development. As one resident said, “I know people don’t get hired because of race. This is America.”</p>
			
			<h4>Systemic barriers beyond qualifications</h4>
			<p>Discriminatory hiring practices and a lack of transparency in job opportunities further limit access for many residents, including those impacted by the criminal justice system. For those reentering the workforce after incarceration, the challenges are even greater, with limited opportunities to secure and maintain good employment.</p>
			
			<p>“In my past, I used to worry about criminal history and getting hired—certain crimes, race too,” shared one participant.</p>
			
			<p>Criminal justice disparities add another layer, making it even harder for workers of color to secure high-quality employment. Many job seekers also face practical challenges such as a lack of childcare and transportation, which restricts access to training programs or job openings in suburban areas.</p>
			
			<h4>Challenges for immigrants</h4>
			<p>For many immigrants, language barriers and cultural differences complicate job access, especially in specialized green sectors that require industry-specific skills. Nearly half of Minnesota’s people of color are foreign-born, compared to 1.9% of white Minnesotans.</p>
			
			<p>Immigrants contribute significantly to the city’s diversity, but they face unique challenges in accessing green jobs. Limited English proficiency and differing cultural norms can deter job seekers. Lin, a 43-year-old with IT training who is taking English classes, captures this challenge: “I went to school for IT A+ and Network+ and was excited to apply, but I’m worried about language barriers and whether I’ll fit in. So, I’ve held back from applying.”</p>
			
			<p>Such challenges make entry and retention in stable roles harder, especially in fields like energy efficiency that demand strong communication and industry-specific skills.</p>
			
			<h4>Educational barriers from childhood to career</h4>
			<p>Green jobs often require advanced degrees or specialized certifications, like a four-year college degree for roles such as sustainability manager or environmental educator. However, disparities in access to green opportunities start young. Inequitable access to high-quality early childhood education in Minnesota has led to some of the nation’s largest racial and ethnic disparities in educational outcomes, leaving many students of color unprepared for high-skill careers. Investments in K-12 schooling yield high social returns.</p>
			
			<p>Students from low-income, predominantly BIPOC high schools often require remedial coursework in college, face extended graduation times, or drop out before completing their degrees. This sets up significant roadblocks to securing well-paying green jobs. As one participant observed, “Everyone might not have the education that others get, so it might not be as easy for others to understand.”</p>
			
			<p>White students in Minnesota consistently achieve higher standardized test scores and graduation rates than students of color, which sets the stage for future disparities in college enrollment and career paths. These early barriers have lasting impacts, restricting access to advanced qualifications and pushing many into lower-quality roles, ultimately limiting their opportunities in the green economy.</p>
			
			<h4>Lack of awareness and knowledge</h4>
			<p>Limited awareness of available career paths restricts access to green jobs for many. Focus group participants shared that the job search process feels confusing and difficult to navigate. “People don’t know where to start; they feel like there aren’t opportunities, and they don’t know where to look,” noted Kim, a 33-year-old carpentry graduate.</p>
			
			<p>Many job seekers struggle with essential tools in today’s market, like online platforms, job fairs, and industry expectations. David, a 26-year-old AmeriCorps student with a construction certificate, voiced his frustration: “I have no experience. I got a construction certificate and searched for jobs online using Indeed.” This lack of clear entry pathways, combined with limited training options, leaves many potential workers unable to leverage their skills in a rapidly evolving job market.</p>
			
			<p>TOPCities user research revealed that job seekers are largely unaware of green job pathways, and have difficulty finding relevant information. Job boards often overlook climate-positive roles and lack specifics on pathways, skills, and local training. National platforms rarely connect job seekers to local resources, training providers, or support organizations, widening the gap. For individuals entering new fields, unfamiliarity with online job platforms like Indeed and LinkedIn further complicates access. Employers, meanwhile, face difficulties recruiting skilled labor and are investing in training to bridge these gaps, emphasizing the need for support that links job seekers to resources essential for navigating this growing field.</p>

			<!-- Underrepresentation Fuels Economic Disparities Section -->
			<h2>Underrepresentation fuels economic disparities</h2>
			<p>Barriers to green jobs access create a cycle where BIPOC individuals, especially Black residents, are often excluded from high-paying quality roles that build prosperity and intergenerational wealth, even as climate resilience funding surges. This exclusion risks deepening existing socioeconomic inequalities, particularly as climate impacts continue to hit vulnerable communities the hardest.</p>
			
			<p>Historic redlining concentrated poverty in certain areas, limiting economic mobility. It also lowered credit scores in non-white areas and higher rents in historically redlined neighborhoods. For example, Saint Paul’s Black homeownership rates remain among the lowest nationally, stifling opportunities for wealth accumulation, as homeownership has long been a key avenue for building wealth. In the U.S., the wealth gap between Black and white households would take an estimated 240 years to close at current rates. Racial covenants historically restricted where people of color could live, relegating them to areas with fewer resources and lower property values. The result has been a sustained wealth gap between white residents and residents of color, as property ownership and value appreciation have long been avenues for wealth building as well as education and training necessary for high-paying green jobs.</p>
			
			<p>In Saint Paul, these patterns have caused Black and Latine workers to reside in more central neighborhoods, while industrial jobs have shifted to land-rich suburban and exurban locations, increasing unemployment in these central areas. In a more rural example, Native American college graduates who live in rural reservations face limited occupational options and job opportunities.</p>
			
			<p>The economic impact of these barriers shows up starkly in wage disparities. Across all sectors and green job quality categories, white workers tend to have higher income ranges compared to other racial groups. For example, while Asian workers in green construction earn closer to their white peers, Black and Latine workers tend to earn significantly less even in similar roles. This wage disparity becomes especially pronounced in high-quality green jobs, which offer the most economic stability and benefits.</p>

			<p>Without access to these high-paying roles, many BIPOC communities miss opportunities to build financial stability. They forgo the chance to save for retirement, invest in homeownership, and provide for future generations—further widening the wealth gap.</p>
			
			<p>As a focus group participant observed, “These jobs are making a difference in our community. During COVID, there was less traffic and air travel, and you could see the positive impact.” However, without equitable access, the communities most affected by environmental challenges remain sidelined in the transition to a greener economy.</p>

			<!-- Building an Equitable Climate Workforce Section -->
			<h2>Building an equitable climate workforce</h2>
			<p>Grounded in community research and co-design, the City and County co-created alongside probono technologists at Google.org the “Green Jobs Career Pathways Tool”. The digital tool addresses key barriers, providing a user-friendly platform where job seekers can explore tailored climate-positive career pathways, learn about required skills and qualifications, and connect with local training resources and employers. It also caters to varying digital literacy levels to help individuals with limited online job searching experience, and provides clear and concise information.</p>
			
			<p>The tool addresses various persona needs including for employers, aspiring career entrants, career changers and more.</p>
			
			<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/19676201"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script><noscript><img src="https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/19676201/thumbnail" width="100%" alt="Personas card from user research" /></noscript></div>
			
			<p>Liz Boyer, Saint Paul’s Climate Action Coordinator, stated, “The TOPCities collaboration and development of a Career Pathways Tool are an exciting addition to this work. These initiatives will help to provide clear, accessible career paths for job seekers and connections to local support while also helping local businesses find the talent they need to meet the growing demand for clean energy solutions.”</p>
			
			<p>Beyond TOPCities, Saint Paul and Ramsey County have launched initiatives to bridge gaps in green job access. Saint Paul’s Climate Action and Resilience Plan focuses on a just transition, creating equitable access to clean energy careers for BIPOC communities.</p>
			
			<p>“Addressing the underrepresentation of women and BIPOC individuals in high-quality clean energy jobs is critical to achieving a just transition to a sustainable future. We’re working to close this gap by prioritizing workforce development programs specifically designed for underrepresented communities,” said Boyer.</p>
			
			<p>Ramsey County’s Climate Equity Action Plan aims to equip BIPOC residents for emerging green construction and clean energy roles. “Roughly 85% of participants in our green construction and HVAC programs are non-white,” shared Rachael Molenaar, Interim Planning Manager at Ramsey County.</p>
			
			<p>To support a diverse workforce, Ramsey County’s Workforce Innovation Board launched resources like Job Connect, a free job board, Inclusive Hiring Connections Summit, and the Inclusive Employer Toolkit. These initiatives offer practical guidance for companies to foster diversity. As John O’Phelan, Planning Specialist II at Ramsey County Workforce Equity & Contracting Inclusion, emphasized, “These tools are helping employers across sectors build and retain a more diverse workforce, aligning with our broader goals for an inclusive green economy.”</p>
			
			<p>Google.org technologists co-created mockups of the Career Pathways Tool, currently in development and testing with local residents. This testing ensures the tool meets user needs before a public launch.</p>

			<p>Looking ahead, both Saint Paul and Ramsey County are committed to scaling up these efforts and leveraging new federal funding opportunities through the BIL and IRA. Their vision is a more inclusive, sustainable green economy that benefits all residents so that no community is left behind as they transition to a climate-resilient future. As Molenaar highlighted, “The community research completed as a component of the TOPCities program will inform the work of the County as we move forward in seeking resources and funding to support BIPOC communities.”</p>
